				<h1>Cultural Blog 8: Conflict</h1>
				<h4>August 30, 2015</h4>

				<p>Back at one of my previous jobs, I was asked to some points of pride in the form of data for a press release. The instructions were pretty vague and my coworker did not specify what kind of data they wanted. I picked and chose what I thought would be best and delivered it to her. Unfortunately, she responded that it wasn't quite what she was looking for and wanted numbers that looked better. Again, she lacked specificity.</p>

				<p>I tried again with a different set of data and asked her is this more in line? If not, what exactly do you want? Turns out, it's not what she wanted. And she finally gave me some examples from last year. Truth is, the numbers from this year were not as good and I was not about to falsify data or deliver data that has a bunch of asteriks attached noting that X,Y, and Z were filtered out. I told her this and she did not like it one bit. I couldn't think of any way to resolve this so I kicked it up to my manager.</p>

				<p>I was frustrated because I didn't feel like I was receiving clear instructions and her asks were unreasonable. I felt angry because she seemed to so easily discount the work I was helping her with. Nor did I want to be the one responsible for providing bad data. I felt if this goes wrong, it'll ultimately come back to me. At the same time, I understand she was trying to her job and make the company look good in the press release. She may not have understood why the numbers were not as great as the previous year. We had a unsatisfying phone call and I finally kicked it up to my boss. A few moments later I got an email saying that I "was off the hook" for doing this. That made me more angry as her request was as a favor. She works in a different department and I do not report to her.</p>

				<p>If I were to go back, I think I would of asked for more concrete details in the initial description. I think I would also have gotten on the phone quicker instead of back and forth emails which only build resentment. I probably also should of brought in my boss earlier.</p>

				<p>My biggest takeway is that prompt and clear communication is the best way to get things done without hurting feelings. As the day and emails dragged on, it was clear that we just needed to talk. When we finally did,  I think neither of us was in a great mood to be working together.</p>
