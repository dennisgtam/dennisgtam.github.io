				<h1>Tech Blog 9: The Blog</h1>
				<h4>September 6th, 2015</h4>

				<p>I have a really really hard time with HTML and CSS. I really don't have an eye for design and I'm having a lot of trouble making it look alright. It's not something I enjoy doing, though I know how valuable it is to know. And I would say I know and understand CSS and HTML. I'm confident in my ability to reproduce someone else's work without looking at their HTML/CSS too much. I have a very hard time creating something that I think looks good without being derivative.</p>

				<p>I can't say there's anything I really liked about working on my own site. Blogging was somewhat useful to help me organize and review for the week. I actually spent way more than the average time on my technical blog posts. Writing  takes a lot out  of me and I've often wanted to talk about code sso there's a good portion of each week where I try to think of relevant code for my blog.</p>

				<p>On the other hand, the cultural blogs weren't that difficult.  And it was interesting to think about the questions/problems for them. Unlike the technical blogs, I got to share my opinions on things. It wasn't cut and dry and  it also took a lot  less time.</p>

				<p>There's still things I want to implement. I want to make the site more functional as well as more beautiful. I have an idea of how to do the first with Jquery. I still feel pretty lost on the second. Still, substance over style right? That plus, I'm sure that a serious graphic designer will do a far better job for any serious project I'll work on the future.  I'll be happy to stick to Ruby.</p>
