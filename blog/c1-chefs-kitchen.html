        <h1>Cultural Blog 1</h1>
        <h4>July 11th, 2015</h4> 
            <p>
      Alright, here's the first cultural blog for DevBootcamp. I want to talk about DBC learning culture, my experience so far, and impostor syndrome.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the video, Shereef made a comment about the two most common approaches people have with DBC: a consumer mindset and an active mindset. A consumer will go into the program expecting things to be handed to them, that DBC promises that you'll learn these things and that DBC will teach you them.
     </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, an active mindset comes into DBC seeing oppportunity and the chance to reach out and expand beyond what might just be said in lectures. So far, I feel like the curriculum encourages an active style of learning. The instructions are clear but there's a lot of research, experimentation, and self study that I needed to do to really feel comfortable about this stuff. I like this style of teaching a lot and there's a great community of people that I can reach out to if I need help.

    </p>
    <p>
        Everyone I've talked to so far seems super excited to be here and discussions in the Google group are lively. Everyone's working together and learning together. I'm excited to be meeting everyone in person.
    </p>

    <p>

    As for impostor syndrome, it's something that I've felt before. When I was in graduate school, I really wasn't sure I belonged there. There were a lot of really smart people and I couldn't imagine how I could compete with them.
    </p>

    <p>
      But that was the completely wrong mindset. It was a not a competition. We all came from different backgrounds and experience levels. I was pretty bad with biochemistry and I totally felt I didn't belong. On the other hand, I was decent at synthesis. I helped my classmates with synthesis and they helped me with biochem. Point is, we were all capable, just in different ways. 

    </p>

    <p>
      In my intro session, I had the pleasure of meeting some really awesome people. And yeah, some people are super far along already. Someone was using natural language processing to study books and that's freaking awesome. I look forward to learning from him and I'm sure there's things I'll have a natural handle on that I can help other people with. 
      </p>

      <p>
        We all made it into the program. We may not be starting at the same place, but we all know where we want to go. We'll go together.
