				<h1>Cultural Blog 5: Feedback</h1>
				<h4>August 10, 2015</h4>

				<p>I'm wrapping up week 5 of phase 0 of Devbootcamp and  it's time to reflect on some of the learning processes, namely feedback.
</p>
				<p>It's been interesting pairing with fellow students to work over challenges. I enjoy it because I get to learn a lot about how other  people approach problems. I've also learned a lot of new methods from other people's code. It feels very rewarding to teach another person your approach and to gain something from them as well.

</p>
				<p>While nothing has been extremely difficult for me just yet. Pairing has pointed out some of my own weaknesess. I tend to dominate the conversation some times and my pair partner has difficulty getting a word in. It's not something I do intentionally and it's something I'll have to work on.

</p>
				<p>The feedback I've received has been pretty good so far. They've been constructive and kind. I really learned a lot about myself from my pairs feedback. As I mentioned earlier, it really has helped me determine my weaknesses and given me a chance to fix them. On the other hand, writing feedback has been a little difficult for me. I haven't found too many actionable tings to say since I feel most pairing sessions go well. All in all, I think it's been a good time so far.
