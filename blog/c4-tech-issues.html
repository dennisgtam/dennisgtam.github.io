				<h1>Cultural Blog 3: Diversity in Tech</h1>
				<h4>August 2nd, 2015</h4>

				<p>Today I want to talk about diversity in tech. While my DevBoot camp cohort has a good mix of 7 men and 8 women, many major tech companies are heavily male dominated. I don't belive that women do not want to work in technology. Jobs in tech and coding are suppose to be inclusive and merit based. </p>
				
				<p>It's a pretty big problem and let's first look at the numbers. <a href = "http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/">This</a> is a beautiful visualization of troubling diversity issues in tech by the good people at informationisbeautiful.net While the US popluation is 51% female, women account for only about 30% in many tech companies including Apple. Google, and SalesForce. The only tech company to have close to 50% is Pandora with 49% women and eBay at 42%. Other companies that perform poorly include nvidia at 16% and Intel at 25%. Compared to the top 50 US companies where women comprise 46% of the total work force, tech is definitely not in a great place for gender diversity.</p>

				<p>Beyond gender diversity, minorities are also quite under represented in tech. 64% of Americans are white and whites comprise 50%+ of all employees at the tech companies listed in the visualization. The only exception is nvidia with 38% white employees. Asians are the next largest ethnic group with most companies having between 30-40% Asian. However, Asians only reprsent 4% of the US population. Black and latino comprise 16% and 14% respectively yet most companies have less thatn 5% of employees that are black or latino. </p>

				<p>It's a big problem and definitely not an easy issue to take care of. I'm not sure what's causing it, and there's lively debate about how to fix it. I think we'll need a big cultural shift to really see any change. The fact is, most tech companies do not have a culture where women and minorities feel welcome.</p>

				<p>Female engineers at Facebook and Twitter have filed lawsuits over alleged unfair work enviroments. Women are leaving tech and a company cannot just hire a bunch of women to shore up its numbers. There is a lack of female and non asian minority developers in the entire tech workforce. Females and minorities need to be encouraged to go into tech from a younger age. Outreach and cultural sensitivity may also help. Again, it's a big problem and I'm honestly sure how soon and well it can be fixed. It'll be something I'll always be conscious of.   </p>
