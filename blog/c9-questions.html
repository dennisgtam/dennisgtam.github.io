				<h1>Cultural Blog 9: Good Questions</h1>
				<h4>August 30, 2015</h4>

				<p>I haven't asked too many questions in the Google+ Group or on StackOverflow. I'll be analyzing some questions I've seen on websites instead.</p>

				<p>The best questions are always clearly written and as short as they can be while still be illustrative. Clear and concise is always the best. I've seen some rambling questions and it quickly gets frustrating to understand what the person is even asking. Background information is key, but too much of it is distracting.</p>

				<p>Most questions are related to errors in code so it's especially helpful when someone includes a version of the code in question. I say version because no one wants to see the entire program, just the smallest part that you have a question about. This is called the minimal,  complete, and verifiable example. While it is sometimes difficult to reproduce an error outside of your original code, it's a lot to ask of strangers to read your entire program. </p>

				<p>I really recommend the StackOverflow guidelines <a href = "http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">here</a>for learning more about the MCV example. Include the minimal amount of code necessary. Make sure you include everything needed to complete the problem in the minimal code. And finally, make sure the error is reproducible. There's not much of an excuse for not testing your code.</p>

				<p>Being clear, concise, and direct with accompanying MCV code is the best way to get desired answers. However before asking a question, make sure to figure out if someone else has already asked the question. A lot of questions on StackOverflow have been marked as duplicate questions. Asking a question is a non trivial amount of work, it'd be faster to check if someone asked the question first. Even after you post the question, it'll take some time to respond to you  or for someone to mark it as a duplicate and direct you towards your already answered question. When I was in graduate school studying chemistry, my professor often said "Spend two hours in the library before spending two hours in the lab." I think this applies to asking questions too. Find out if your question has already been asked!</p>
