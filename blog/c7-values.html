				<h1>Culturall Blog 7: values</h1>
				<h4>August 23, 2015</h4>

				<p>I used to think happiness is waking up in the morning and the most pressing issue is thinking about what I want to have for dinner in the evening. To me, this embodied a life of ease and happiness. But looking back now, I was only in that state of mind because so many others things were going right in my life. I most prominently remember feeling this way during Junior and Senior year in college. It wasn't that I didn't care about school, in fact I really enjoyed what I was learning and I was happy with the direction my life was going in, so much so, that the most difficult decisionto be made was what to eat. Everything else just felt right.</p>

				<p>It wasn't one of the values listed in the grand table of ideals to choose from, but I think what made me happiest was direction and purpose. I don't feel like I have to know where I'm going, but I do like to know the direction at least. At my old job, I eventually figured that I didn't want to be there, that I didn't want to work towards business development. Without direction and purpose, I grew to resent my job more and more. It took me a long time to break away and come to DevBootcamp. </p>

				<p>Complementary to direction, is faith. I believe this is the right choice for me but it's impossible to know that for sure. I take it on faith that this is what I want to continue to do. And so far, I've found validation for faith. I belive things always have a tendancy to work out. Though it's often unexpected and it may take some time to realize it.</p>

				<p>In regards to advice that my friends have asked me for, I feel having direction and faith are what I usually prescribe. If they're unhappy with their job or their personal relationships, it's important to have an idea of the direction things are heading. And if you don't have enough faith that things will get better, it's time to choose a new direction and take a leap of faith that it will be better.</p>

				<p>I'm not sure any of this will be extremely effective and combatting stereotype threat. I've never really thought of it in regards to stereotype threat. But these values have guided me in the past and I believe they will continue to guide me while at DevBootcamp.</p>
