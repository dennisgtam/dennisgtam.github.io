        <p>I'm wrapping up the 3rd week of Dev Bootcamp and it's time to reflect a bit. First up is my personal thinking style: Abstract Random</p>

        <p>The abstract portion implies an ability to visualize and think about ideas that are can't be seen with one of the 5 senses. Intuition and imagination fall under abstract thought. </p>

        <p>The random part refers to organzation of information in chunks. However, there is no particular order to these chunks. Random thinkers skip steps and can work from the backwards from the end or from the middle.</p>

        <p>Having done a bit more research, it looks my strongest points are my eagerness to work with others and to focus on the issues on hand. On the other hand, I don't do well in restrictive environments and I dislike competition. I also dislike focusing on one thing at a time and I prefer to be flexible about how things work. I should also work harder on giving more concrete and exact details.  </p>

        <p>My biggest struggle so far has been learning CSS. It's something that took a lot of time and was very frustrating. It wasn't something I could walk away from or work on multiple chunks at once. All the elements of the HTML had to be placed and modified in a specific order. I think this speaks to my learning style.</p>

        <p>Now for growth vs. fixed mindset. I feel in order to grow, I need to work on my concrete and sequential thinking patterns. So far an abstract random thinking style has served pretty well, except when I am unable to bounce ideas on other people. While pairing helps with this, solo challenges provide a different obstacle. In solo challenges I think I should pursue more concrete sequential thought patterns if I'm getting stuck on a problem. Thus, I should try and make some solid plans and have some more structure before diving into a problem.</p>
