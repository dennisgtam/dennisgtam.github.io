				<h1>Culturall Blog 6: Inheritance vs. Stereotype Threat</h1>
				<h4>August 10, 2015</h4>

				<p>Stereotype threat is the phenomenom in which negative stereotypes of one's self leads to lower performance in various aspects of life. This correlation has shown up in a number of studies. One of the most prominent involed telling students of African background that the test they were about to take was diagnostic of intelligence. African American students who were told the test was non diagnostic of intelligence scored higher than those who were told the test was indicative of intelligence.</p>

				<p>I do not believe I've suffered from stereotype threat too recently. The best example I could think of is in sports. In the fall of 2014, I joined a kickball league to have something to do on Sunday afternoons and to make some new friends. While I make sure to exercise regularly, I usually do so by lifting and swimming. I've never been good at sports and as a I kid I was often picked last for most team sports. I went into each kickball game with the mentality that I wouldn't be great at it. We didn't win our season but we weren't at the bottom either. My performance was okay. I'm not sure if I would of improved if I had believed I was better at sports.</p>

				<p>I feel the above example is not a true stereotype threat, I don't know if I've  ever truly encountered it. Ever since leaving graduate school, I've had doubts about my ability to make it in the job world. Quitting chemistry was a huge deal for me and it felt like I was walking away from years of education. I didn't apply for certain jobs because I didn't  feel like I was qualified,  because I felt like my past made me look like a quitter. And even now, I left my job in corporate marketing to pursue web development. There's a certain fear of quitting and failure here too. Yet, I keep my head up. This is what I want to do. I can objectively say I did not like my old job and I'm  enjoying  learning a lot more. I have insecurities and doubts about myself and while these doubts can certainly hold me back, none of them are really tied to race, gender, or social group. </p>

				<p>I think the best way to combat stereotype threat is to reinforce self positvity. There are a lot of different ways to go about this but we should definitely avoid stereotype lift. Stereotype lift occurs when a person performs better because they know they're better than a stereotype of another group. While this does improve performance, it comes at the cost of the other group. We must be mindful of our negative stereotypes both of ourselves and of others. We need to realize the stereotypes are only in our heads and that we are definitely not defined by them.</p>
