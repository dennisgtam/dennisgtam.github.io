			<h3><a href="t5-ruby-classes.html">Technical Blog 5: Classes</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">August 9th, 2015</span>
				<p>In this blog post I want to talk about classes. You can think of classes as blueprints for an object. We can define variables and methods inside a class, and every object of that class can access those methods. I know it sounds very jargon heavy but let's dive into an example and talk through it.</p>

			<h3><a href="c5-feedback.html">Cultural Blog 5: Feedback</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">August 9th, 2015</span>
				<p>I'm wrapping up week 5 of phase 0 of Devbootcamp and  it's time to reflect on some of the learning processes, namely feedback.
</p>
				<p>It's been interesting pairing with fellow students to work over challenges. I enjoy it because I get to learn a lot about how other  people approach problems. I've also learned a lot of new methods from other people's code. It feels very rewarding to teach another person your approach and to gain something from them as well.

			<h3><a href="t4-enumerable-methods.html">Technical Blog 4: Map</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">August 2nd, 2015</span>
				<p>This week I'm going over the map enumberable method. It's a very powerful method that can be called on all enumberables including arrays and hashes. Map is a pretty simple method that is passed a block. Map then applies the block to every element in the array and returns an array of the modified elements. </p>

				<p>Let's first look at how this differs from an each do method.</p>

			<h3><a href="c4-tech-issues.html">Cultural Blog 4: Diversity in Tech</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">August 2nd, 2015</span>
			<p>This week I'm going to talk about two very important and different data structures: <p>Today I want to talk about diversity in tech. While my DevBoot camp cohort has a good mix of 7 men and 8 women, many major tech companies are heavily male dominated. I don't belive that women do not want to work in technology. Jobs in tech and coding are suppose to be inclusive and merit based. </p>
				
				<p>It's a pretty big problem and let's first look at the numbers. <a href = "http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/">This</a> is a beautiful visualization of troubling diversity issues in tech by the good people at informationisbeautiful.net While the US popluation is 51% female, women account for only about 30% in many tech companies including Apple. Google, and SalesForce. The only tech company to have close to 50% is Pandora with 49% women and eBay at 42%. Other companies that perform poorly include nvidia at 16% and Intel at 25%. Compared to the top 50 US companies where women comprise 46% of the total work force, tech is definitely not in a great place for gender diversity.</p>

			<h3><a href="t3-arrays-hashes.html">Technical Blog 3: Arrays and Hashes</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">July 27th, 2015</span>
			<p>This week I'm going to talk about two very important and different data structures: arrays and hashes. Let's dive right into it.</p>
			<h4>Arrays</h4>
			<p>An array is a data structure that can hold multiple values. Unlike other languages, Ruby arrays can be of any size. They can also contain multiple types of objects. An array can contain strings, integers, arrays, and hashes.</p>
			<p>Arrays are like ordered lists. You can access the elements of the list with an index. The index starts at zero. Thus, to access the first element of the list we call array_name[0]. The second element would be accessed with array_name[1]. You can also access the last element with array_name[-1], the second to last element with array_name[-2] etc.</p>

			<h3><a href="c3-thinking-style.html">Technical Blog 3: Element Display Types!</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">July 27th, 2015</span>
			<p>I'm wrapping up the 3rd week of Dev Bootcamp and it's time to reflect a bit. First up is my personal thinking style: Abstract Random</p>
			<p>The abstract portion implies an ability to visualize and think about ideas that are can't be seen with one of the 5 senses. Intuition and imagination fall under abstract thought.</p>
			<p>The random part refers to organzation of information in chunks. However, there is no particular order to these chunks. Random thinkers skip steps and can work from the backwards from the end or from the middle.</p>

			<h3><a href="techblog_2.html">Technical Blog 2: Element Display Types!</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">July 19th, 2015</span>
			<p>Today I'm writing about a topic that caused me a lot of grief while I was working through the challenges. I didn't even know the difference between display types. Certain positioning attributes don't work for every display type and it took me awhile to try and figure it out. I know there's a lot of jargon there, but some examples should clear it up.</p>

			<p>Every element in a HTML file can be assigned a display type. Usually we do this inside of a css file by writing "display: [TYPE]". There are 3 primary types of displays. Instead of writing many paragraphs of text, I put together a little HTML+CSS demonstration. We'll use some colored div blocks to show what they look like.</p>

			<h3><a href="t1-git-blog.html">Technical Blog 1</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">July 11th, 2015</span>
			<p>Okay! So here's the first technical blog I'm writing as part of the DBC phase 0 requirements. This past week has mostly been about Git and GitHub. I'll be describing version control, how git tracks changes, and the benefits of using GitHub to store code.</p>

			<p>What's Version Control?</p>

			<p>Version control is exactly what it sounds like. Version controls lets you keep track of multiple versions of a file. I think this is best illustrated with an example of a poor version control method.</p>

			<h3><a href="c1-chefs-kitchen.html">Cultural Blog 1</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">July 11th, 2015</span>
			<p>Alright, here's the first cultural blog for DevBootcamp. I want to talk about DBC learning culture, my experience so far, and impostor syndrome.</p>

			<p>In the video, Shereef made a comment about the two most common approaches people have with DBC: a consumer mindset and an active mindset. A consumer will go into the program expecting things to be handed to them, that DBC promises that you'll learn these things and that DBC will teach you them.</p>

			<p>On the other hand, an active mindset comes into DBC seeing oppportunity and the chance to reach out and expand beyond what might just be said in lectures. So far, I feel like the curriculum encourages an active style of learning. The instructions are clear but there's a lot of research, experimentation, and self study that I needed to do to really feel comfortable about this stuff. I like this style of teaching a lot and there's a great community of people that I can reach out to if I need help.</p>
