			<h3><a href="t8-tech.html">Technical Blog 8: Web Frameworks and Ruby on Rails</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">August 30th, 2015</span>
				<p>While we've covered HTML, CSS, and now JS, we haven't really gotten into building any web applications yet. In fact, we haven't built any web application at all yet. All our Ruby has been localized to our personal machines and is not connnected to the web in any way. There's a lot that goes behind the scenes in web applications and it'd be a huge pain if we had to take care of them everytime we want to create one. A web framework helps us bridge the gap between the Ruby we've been using and the Ruby we'll be using on the web. But first, we have to understand how the web works what a web framework does.</p>


				<p>This is a gross oversimplifcation but the internet is a bunch of computers that are connected and know how to talk each other. Files on these computers are most often collected onto web servers. A web server both the physical device and the application that holds all these files. A browser is the principal way that a computer talks to a web server. The browser communicates with the server via something called the HTTP protocol. In response to the HTTP request, the server will a deliver HTML file to the computer that called it and the browser will  render the HTML.</p>

			<h3><a href="t8-conflict.html">Cultural Blog 8: Conflict</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">August 23rd, 2015</span>
				<p>Back at one of my previous jobs, I was asked to some points of pride in the form of data for a press release. The instructions were pretty vague and my coworker did not specify what kind of data they wanted. I picked and chose what I thought would be best and delivered it to her. Unfortunately, she responded that it wasn't quite what she was looking for and wanted numbers that looked better. Again, she lacked specificity.</p>

				<p>I tried again with a different set of data and asked her is this more in line? If not, what exactly do you want? Turns out, it's not what she wanted. And she finally gave me some examples from last year. Truth is, the numbers from this year were not as good and I was not about to falsify data or deliver data that has a bunch of asteriks attached noting that X,Y, and Z were filtered out. I told her this and she did not like it one bit. I couldn't think of any way to resolve this so I kicked it up to my manager.</p><p>This week I started learning some JavaScript. It's the language of the web and it's what used to manipulate
				a lot of things on the front end of the application, most often the HTML. It shares a lot of basic functionality
				with Ruby but is a lot looser on a lot of things too.</p>

			<h3><a href="t7-JavaScript.html">Technical Blog 7: JavaScript Objects</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">August 23rd, 2015</span>
				<p>This week I started learning some JavaScript. It's the language of the web and it's what used to manipulate
				a lot of things on the front end of the application, most often the HTML. It shares a lot of basic functionality
				with Ruby but is a lot looser on a lot of things too.</p>

				<p>Like Ruby, JavaScript has objects. The most striking difference is how similar to Ruby Hashes they are. In the literal
				declaration of an object, the syntax looks very much like a Ruby hash. Like in Ruby, JavaScript variables have scope. Variables declared inside functions (JS for methods) are limited to the functions that created them. Similar to Ruby instance variables,
				JS objects can hold variables as well.</p>

			<h3><a href="c7-values.html">Cultural Blog 7: Values</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">August 23rd, 2015</span>
				<p>I used to think happiness is waking up in the morning and the most pressing issue is thinking about what I want to have for dinner in the evening. To me, this embodied a life of ease and happiness. But looking back now, I was only in that state of mind because so many others things were going right in my life. I most prominently remember feeling this way during Junior and Senior year in college. It wasn't that I didn't care about school, in fact I really enjoyed what I was learning and I was happy with the direction my life was going in, so much so, that the most difficult decisionto be made was what to eat. Everything else just felt right.</p>

				<p>It wasn't one of the values listed in the grand table of ideals to choose from, but I think what made me happiest was direction and purpose. I don't feel like I have to know where I'm going, but I do like to know the direction at least. At my old job, I eventually figured that I didn't want to be there, that I didn't want to work towards business development. Without direction and purpose, I grew to resent my job more and more. It took me a long time to break away and come to DevBootcamp. </p>

			<h3><a href="t6-oop-concepts.html">Technical Blog 6: Inheritance and Composition</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">August 10th, 2015</span>
				<p>This week we're going to talk about inheritance and composition, two things in Ruby that help with D.R.Y when 
				working with classes. Inheritance is pretty straight forward and and easy to explain so let's dive it into first.</p>

				<p>Every class in Ruby can have one class it inherits from. A parent class can have an unlimited number of children 
				classes. However, each child class can only have one parent. The child inherits all methods the parent class has.
				Let's look at an example.</p>

			<h3><a href="c6-stereotype-threat.html">Cultural Blog 6: Stereotype Threat</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">August 10th, 2015</span>
				<p>Stereotype threat is the phenomenom in which negative stereotypes of one's self leads to lower performance in various aspects of life. This correlation has shown up in a number of studies. One of the most prominent involed telling students of African background that the test they were about to take was diagnostic of intelligence. African American students who were told the test was non diagnostic of intelligence scored higher than those who were told the test was indicative of intelligence.</p>

				<p>I do not believe I've suffered from stereotype threat too recently. The best example I could think of is in sports. In the fall of 2014, I joined a kickball league to have something to do on Sunday afternoons and to make some new friends. While I make sure to exercise regularly, I usually do so by lifting and swimming. I've never been good at sports and as a I kid I was often picked last for most team sports. I went into each kickball game with the mentality that I wouldn't be great at it. We didn't win our season but we weren't at the bottom either. My performance was okay. I'm not sure if I would of improved if I had believed I was better at sports.</p>

			<h3><a href="t5-ruby-classes.html">Technical Blog 5: Classes</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">August 9th, 2015</span>
				<p>In this blog post I want to talk about classes. You can think of classes as blueprints for an object. We can define variables and methods inside a class, and every object of that class can access those methods. I know it sounds very jargon heavy but let's dive into an example and talk through it.</p>

			<h3><a href="c5-feedback.html">Cultural Blog 5: Feedback</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">August 9th, 2015</span>
				<p>I'm wrapping up week 5 of phase 0 of Devbootcamp and  it's time to reflect on some of the learning processes, namely feedback.
</p>
				<p>It's been interesting pairing with fellow students to work over challenges. I enjoy it because I get to learn a lot about how other  people approach problems. I've also learned a lot of new methods from other people's code. It feels very rewarding to teach another person your approach and to gain something from them as well.

			<h3><a href="t4-enumerable-methods.html">Technical Blog 4: Map</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">August 2nd, 2015</span>
				<p>This week I'm going over the map enumberable method. It's a very powerful method that can be called on all enumberables including arrays and hashes. Map is a pretty simple method that is passed a block. Map then applies the block to every element in the array and returns an array of the modified elements. </p>

				<p>Let's first look at how this differs from an each do method.</p>

			<h3><a href="c4-tech-issues.html">Cultural Blog 4: Diversity in Tech</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">August 2nd, 2015</span>
			<p>This week I'm going to talk about two very important and different data structures: <p>Today I want to talk about diversity in tech. While my DevBoot camp cohort has a good mix of 7 men and 8 women, many major tech companies are heavily male dominated. I don't belive that women do not want to work in technology. Jobs in tech and coding are suppose to be inclusive and merit based. </p>
				
				<p>It's a pretty big problem and let's first look at the numbers. <a href = "http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/">This</a> is a beautiful visualization of troubling diversity issues in tech by the good people at informationisbeautiful.net While the US popluation is 51% female, women account for only about 30% in many tech companies including Apple. Google, and SalesForce. The only tech company to have close to 50% is Pandora with 49% women and eBay at 42%. Other companies that perform poorly include nvidia at 16% and Intel at 25%. Compared to the top 50 US companies where women comprise 46% of the total work force, tech is definitely not in a great place for gender diversity.</p>

			<h3><a href="t3-arrays-hashes.html">Technical Blog 3: Arrays and Hashes</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">July 27th, 2015</span>
			<p>This week I'm going to talk about two very important and different data structures: arrays and hashes. Let's dive right into it.</p>
			<h4>Arrays</h4>
			<p>An array is a data structure that can hold multiple values. Unlike other languages, Ruby arrays can be of any size. They can also contain multiple types of objects. An array can contain strings, integers, arrays, and hashes.</p>
			<p>Arrays are like ordered lists. You can access the elements of the list with an index. The index starts at zero. Thus, to access the first element of the list we call array_name[0]. The second element would be accessed with array_name[1]. You can also access the last element with array_name[-1], the second to last element with array_name[-2] etc.</p>

			<h3><a href="c3-thinking-style.html">Technical Blog 3: Element Display Types!</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">July 27th, 2015</span>
			<p>I'm wrapping up the 3rd week of Dev Bootcamp and it's time to reflect a bit. First up is my personal thinking style: Abstract Random</p>
			<p>The abstract portion implies an ability to visualize and think about ideas that are can't be seen with one of the 5 senses. Intuition and imagination fall under abstract thought.</p>
			<p>The random part refers to organzation of information in chunks. However, there is no particular order to these chunks. Random thinkers skip steps and can work from the backwards from the end or from the middle.</p>

			<h3><a href="techblog_2.html">Technical Blog 2: Element Display Types!</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">July 19th, 2015</span>
			<p>Today I'm writing about a topic that caused me a lot of grief while I was working through the challenges. I didn't even know the difference between display types. Certain positioning attributes don't work for every display type and it took me awhile to try and figure it out. I know there's a lot of jargon there, but some examples should clear it up.</p>

			<p>Every element in a HTML file can be assigned a display type. Usually we do this inside of a css file by writing "display: [TYPE]". There are 3 primary types of displays. Instead of writing many paragraphs of text, I put together a little HTML+CSS demonstration. We'll use some colored div blocks to show what they look like.</p>

			<h3><a href="t1-git-blog.html">Technical Blog 1</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">July 11th, 2015</span>
			<p>Okay! So here's the first technical blog I'm writing as part of the DBC phase 0 requirements. This past week has mostly been about Git and GitHub. I'll be describing version control, how git tracks changes, and the benefits of using GitHub to store code.</p>

			<p>What's Version Control?</p>

			<p>Version control is exactly what it sounds like. Version controls lets you keep track of multiple versions of a file. I think this is best illustrated with an example of a poor version control method.</p>

			<h3><a href="c1-chefs-kitchen.html">Cultural Blog 1</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">July 11th, 2015</span>
			<p>Alright, here's the first cultural blog for DevBootcamp. I want to talk about DBC learning culture, my experience so far, and impostor syndrome.</p>

			<p>In the video, Shereef made a comment about the two most common approaches people have with DBC: a consumer mindset and an active mindset. A consumer will go into the program expecting things to be handed to them, that DBC promises that you'll learn these things and that DBC will teach you them.</p>

			<p>On the other hand, an active mindset comes into DBC seeing oppportunity and the chance to reach out and expand beyond what might just be said in lectures. So far, I feel like the curriculum encourages an active style of learning. The instructions are clear but there's a lot of research, experimentation, and self study that I needed to do to really feel comfortable about this stuff. I like this style of teaching a lot and there's a great community of people that I can reach out to if I need help.</p>
