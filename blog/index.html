				I am recommending that anyone who has a $12 and just over an hour to spare head over to Gorilla Tango Theatre to see Robert Eric Shoemaker’s new adaptation of Orson Welles’s 1938 Halloween broadcast of his adaptation (along with writer Howard Koch and several other contributors) of H.G. Wells’s novel War of the Worlds. I make this recommendation not because this is a flawless production, but because Shoemaker and his team attempt to cram a whole lot of ideas into the tiny storefront in that hour plus change, and what they accomplish is not only admirable but a heck of a lot of fun.

Providing the structure is a decent abridgment of the original The Mercury Theatre on the Air broadcast on CBS. Shoemaker’s adaptation somehow manages to hit all the major plot points, but it intersperses the taping with the off-air conversations of the cast, the studio head’s attempts to defang the production and Welles’s opinions on art, artists and women—not all of them endearing. The play meanders along, managing to imply the occasionally tedious pace of the original without actually adopting it (thankfully!), until the broadcast is interrupted by...at this point, it’s every man or woman for himself, both onstage and in the audience because the nature of the interruption is disorienting at best. What is real, what is media sensationalism, what is fear? Shoemaker’s adaptation is a dialogue with Welles and the original radio broadcast, offering a springboard for contemplating the role of the media in shaping reality, and how that role has changed. And not.

All but Welles purists will appreciate the mixture of real and imagined characters on the set of CBS. The audience is welcomed by a CBS courier named Rose Budd. Somehow, John Houseman and Agnes Moorehead (Bible in hand, as was often the case) have joined the broadcast along with Orson Welles and Bernard Herrmann. This allows Shoemaker to slip in some Mercury Theatre trivia, as Houseman and Moorehead both worked with Welles there, Houseman being one of the producers of War of the Worlds, among other things. The actors who take on these roles do not much resemble their real-life counterparts (except for Sean S. Thomas’s Welles), but when they read their lines they bring the radio broadcast to life. There are some clever references to the original (the source of the voice for Carl Phillips, jokes about Campbell’s soup being an unattainable sponsor), but prior knowledge of the radio broadcast is not required to enjoy the re-creation, Foley effects (provided by James Brooks and Luis Badillo) and all. It is the off-air play that really sets apart this adaptation, however, telling the story of the behind-the-scenes efforts to change the broadcast (again, a mix of the fictional and what really occurred), the newspaper accounts of the “panic” that followed (not nearly as hysterical as the tabloids made out), Welles own future (no, he wasn’t finished after the broadcast aired) and the future of the media.
