			<p>Hi there! This part is still incomplete. I want to turn this into a date side bar with drop downs for each month that will display the blog posts in order.</p>

			<p>The Technical/Cultural/Misc/All buttons should filter but that's also to come!</p>

			<h3><a href="techblog_2.html">Technical Blog 2: Element Display Types!</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">July 19th, 2015</span>
			<p>Today I'm writing about a topic that caused me a lot of grief while I was working through the challenges. I didn't even know the difference between display types. Certain positioning attributes don't work for every display type and it took me awhile to try and figure it out. I know there's a lot of jargon there, but some examples should clear it up.</p>

			<p>Every element in a HTML file can be assigned a display type. Usually we do this inside of a css file by writing "display: [TYPE]". There are 3 primary types of displays. Instead of writing many paragraphs of text, I put together a little HTML+CSS demonstration. We'll use some colored div blocks to show what they look like.</p>

			<h3><a href="t1-git-blog.html">Technical Blog 1</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">July 11th, 2015</span>
			<p>Okay! So here's the first technical blog I'm writing as part of the DBC phase 0 requirements. This past week has mostly been about Git and GitHub. I'll be describing version control, how git tracks changes, and the benefits of using GitHub to store code.</p>

			<p>What's Version Control?</p>

			<p>Version control is exactly what it sounds like. Version controls lets you keep track of multiple versions of a file. I think this is best illustrated with an example of a poor version control method.</p>

			<h3><a href="c1-chefs-kitchen.html">Cultural Blog 1</a></h3>
			<span class="blog-date">July 11th, 2015</span>
			<p>Alright, here's the first cultural blog for DevBootcamp. I want to talk about DBC learning culture, my experience so far, and impostor syndrome.</p>

			<p>In the video, Shereef made a comment about the two most common approaches people have with DBC: a consumer mindset and an active mindset. A consumer will go into the program expecting things to be handed to them, that DBC promises that you'll learn these things and that DBC will teach you them.</p>

			<p>On the other hand, an active mindset comes into DBC seeing oppportunity and the chance to reach out and expand beyond what might just be said in lectures. So far, I feel like the curriculum encourages an active style of learning. The instructions are clear but there's a lot of research, experimentation, and self study that I needed to do to really feel comfortable about this stuff. I like this style of teaching a lot and there's a great community of people that I can reach out to if I need help.</p>
